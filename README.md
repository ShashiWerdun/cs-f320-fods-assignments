# Implementing ML algorithms from scratch

This repository implements [polynomial regression](./Polynomial%20Regression) using gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent and [feature selection](./Feature%20Selection/) using greedy forward and greedy backward selection without the use of popular machine learning libraries like scikit learn.
